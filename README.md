# The_Arch_Enemies
Hey everyone!

This is my very first simple 2D game. It's a shooting game for two players. I've named it “The Arch Enemies” because the battle is between two “classic” adversaries – a cat and a mouse.

Both have 10 lives. Whichever one loses all their lives first, loses the game. Since a cat is naturally larger than a mouse, it's easier to hit the cat. As a result, the cat is allowed up to 10 bullets on the screen at once, while the mouse can have only 5. As soon as a bullet leaves the screen, they can shoot another. Additionally, the size of the bullets varies; the cat's bullets are slightly larger.

Another distinction is the mouse's speed – it moves faster than the cat.

I'm open to any comments or constructive criticism. Thank you!
